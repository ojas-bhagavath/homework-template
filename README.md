# homework-template

This is a Typst template that I personally use for submitting my homeworks and assignments. It is heavily inspired by the [adaptable-pset](https://typst.app/universe/package/adaptable-pset/) template.  
I use this template locally, and I do not yet intend to publish this on Typst Universe. Follow the installation instructions to locally clone and use this template.
